# Weather-Dashboard

## Description 

With this project the user can search for cities and access both current and future weather conditions. When a city is searched, the dashboard presents the user with conditions such as the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for both current and future weather conditions. Furthermore, the city is added to the search history (and local storage) for easy reference. By clicking on a city in the search history, users can quickly revisit both current and future weather conditions for that specific city. This project was built to help me better understand server side APIs. More specifically, how to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
